NOTES!
If you want to use SDXL models add xl, sdxl to its filename!
If you want to use v-prediction models add vp, v-pred or others to the filename!
These two thing can be combined together.
Civitai is able to fully read the generated image metadata expect for the model name. Keep that in mind.
It still lacks some futures but I'm proud of what it is capable of doing now ðŸ˜Š
